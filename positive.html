        <h1>Silver Lining the Pandemic, an Overview</h1>
        <p>The Coronavirus pandemic has changed our collective way of life. It significantly altered the way many of us
          shop, learn, work, and live. It isolated large swaths of the global collective from friends and family. It
          impacted the physical and mental health of millions, in some cases, resulting in death or long term illness. The
          pandemic has turned normal living into a way of life many of us never fathomed. It is easy to get immersed in
          bad news about the pandemic, due to the disruptive way it exploded across all aspects of everyday life. This
          website will provide a brief glimpse at how college students were impacted by the coronavirus and the response
          intended to minimize its impact. For students, the challenges were significant.</p>
        <p> We found that most students had to immediately transition to some form of distance learning, or stop school
          altogether due to changes in their or their families’ sources of income. Many faced physical or mental health
          problems due to the virus, lack of access to medical care for other conditions due to resources being
          reallocated to fight the virus, and mental stress from prolonged isolation as a result of enforced closures
          intended to mitigate viral spread. Some students were enrolled in schools that were not prepared to offer online
          or distance courses, and expressed concern about the quality of the education they received through distance and
          online modalities.</p>
        <p>Despite all of the challenges caused by Covid-19, there were some positives to emerge from this disaster. The
          examples we share in this section look at the resilience of college students during the pandemic. We found
          studies suggesting that the pandemic helped medical students become more empathetic. There were also examples of
          students successfully adapting to online study. Further, while some universities struggled with their
          infrastructure and capacity for online courses, the authors demonstrated how institutions used innovative
          practices to provide flexibility and additional support to students.</p>

        <div class="empathy">
          <h2>Gain in Empathy</h2>
          <img class="img_heart" src="images/empathy.jpeg" alt="hands making a heart"> 
          <p>According to research by Ghaus, Waheed, Khan, Mustafa, Siddique, and Waqar Quershi (2020), the pandemic
            heightened medical students' sense of empathy. Prior to the pandemic, the authors noted a drop in empathy
            amongst dental students at the Islamic International Dental College, Islamabad each year as they progressed
            through their medical program and received more clinical experience. During the pandemic, students were
            quarantined and had to transition to online courses. When they were able to return to practice,
            …the data was re-collected from the same population, surprising results were obtained. Therefore, the present
            study not only calculated the change in empathy levels between the first and the final year which was evident
            previously, but it also showed a marked and significant improvement in the empathy levels of the students after
            facing the pandemic (Ghaus, et. all, 2020, p. S114).
            While the researchers acknowledged that the unique circumstances would make this study hard to replicate, they
            hypothesized that the underpinning theme of death and chaos that the students were immersed in may have helped
            heighten their ability to empathize with others.

        <div class="skills">
          <h2>Gains in Adaptability Skills</h2>
          <img class="img_screen" src="images/adapt.jpeg" alt="a computer screen that says how we adapt">
          <p>As previously mentioned, the pandemic affected the work and school life of millions. For students enrolled in
            residential programs, where they planned to meet face-to-face with their instructors in peers, they were in
            in-person classes one day and in cyberspace the next. Some of these students had never experienced online
            classes before; in some cases the transition was shocking, and required students to adjust to a new way of
            learning. This format required strong time management skills and self-regulation with (in many cases) no
            substantive training on how to move forward.
    
            Overwhelmingly, students struggled with this sudden change, and while most struggled, many survived the change.
            A few thrived! For example, because of the quick switch from in-person to completely virtual, students gained
            adaptability skills. Besser and Flett (2020) surveyed over 1,000 Israeli college students about their
            adaptability to online schooling, in order to understand how college students had to adjust to sudden change
            (2020, p. 2). Their preliminary findings are that this pandemic forced people to adapt to new ways of learning.
            These are skills that are not easily forgotten and will be useful for present and future days (Besser and Flett,
            2020, pp. 18-19).
    
            This pandemic pushed us all to live with uncertainty for the future. We don’t know when exactly things will
            return to the ways they were before, or if they even will. Nevertheless, the world keeps turning and life keeps
            moving forward. All we can do is adapt to new situations. As Elizabeth Heath states, adaptability “was an
            important survival skill even before the pandemic” (2020). But now, in a world of constant change, adaptability
            has become a necessary trait, and it is teaching us many useful lessons. For example, we are learning to live
            through discomfort, and we are learning how to deal with that (Heath, 2020). Being able to face these trying
            times and to get through them teaches us how to cope and how to adjust. And since life, in general, is
            unpredictable, adaptability is indeed a valuable skill we are gaining from this pandemic.

        <div class="innovation">
          <h2>College Innovations</h2>
          <img class="img_lightbulb" src="images/innovation.jpeg" alt="a thought bubble with a light bulb in the center">
          <p>The switch to fully remote learning was perhaps thought to be a short-term change that would last for only a few
            weeks when schools first shifted to this model. It turned out that this was not the case. After experiencing
            fully remote learning for half of a semester, universities around the world noted rising infection rates and
            deaths over the summer. With no vaccine in sight, it was clear that things would not be able to return to normal
            during 2020. This pushed colleges and universities to plan ways to support their students in ways that were
            dramatically different from the norm. In this section we look at some of the innovations that arose as students
            shifted to hybrid and online modes of learning.
    
            According to Keystone Academic Solutions, universities are seeing that being a digital academic school makes
            them more available to students who might not have been able to go to them for higher education (n.d.). Indeed,
            students may have wanted to go to a specific college but couldn’t because they couldn’t move there. Moving to
            digital schooling seems to have shown innovation that may be useful for future schooling. We are seeing a trend
            in schools realizing how remote learning can have advantages. (Keystone Academic Solutions, n.d.).
    
            However, the future is still unclear. Will schools keep virtual learning an option, or will schools drop all
            virtual classes? If anything, it is safe to say that the pandemic forced innovative changes and these changes
            will certainly affect future teaching/learning. Technology played a huge, dependable role in education during
            the pandemic. It seems that technology will continue to play an important role.

        <div class="flexibility">
          <h2>Schedule Flexibility</h2>
          <img class="img_yoga" src="images/flexible.jpeg" alt="a mom doing yoga with her daughter">
          <p>There were mixed reactions from students about the shift to online classes. Trinity Washington University
            president Patricia McGuire explains, "Academically, while we want to focus on still having quality and rigor, we
            want to be as flexible as possible so that no one is penalized because of this extremely bizarre situation" St.
            Amour (2020).” 
          There are plenty
            of reasons for this. According to Lei (2020), “students have experienced positive things from going fully
            virtual. For example, being a virtual college student gave them more freedom. Many college students have
            responsibilities that are difficult to juggle when they have to go to classes. But virtual classes allow them to
            create their own schedules.” Having
            this freedom means that college students with strong time management skills and a developed level of
            self-regulation can handle school and responsibilities at the same time.”
    
            Students that are parents are in a unique situation. Douglas-Gabriel (2020) shares “Colleges and universities
            have long struggled to meet the needs of the estimated 4.3 million undergraduates — about one in five — with
            children”. If
            universities work with students to make sure they understand the differences in workloads for different
            modalities of courses, this could be a great option for some students who had not previously considered
            alternative forms of higher education outside of traditional face-to-face settings. While students who are
            parents would still have to find childcare while they focus on their studies, they may have more options outside
            of daycare, due to the flexibility that asynchronous and some hybrid learning options allow.</p>
