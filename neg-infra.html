                <h3>College students During the Pandemic</h3>
               <p>
        When a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in March, 2020, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344934039">Karmachary, Paudel, and Adhikari (2020)</a> noted that around 181 countries in the world have held back their education system till 1st May 2020 for 73.5% (1.3 billion young people) of enrolled learners worldwide. When colleges and universities transitioned to online or distance education, the move was not equitable for all. According to <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/coronavirus-deepens-the-digital-divide/">United Nations</a> estimates, about half of the world's population (46%) is not connected to the internet. By October of 2020, Members of the European Parliament observed that “<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home">32% of pupils in some member states not having had any access to education for several months</a>”. This lack of access has helped highlight a digital divide that was persistent prior to this health emergency. In Nepal, for example,<a href="see https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/nepals-challenges-delivering-education-amidst-covid-19">Farid, Hayes, and Sirkhell (2021)</a> highlight attempts to continue classroom learning remotely, through broadcasts on television and radio and online platforms, though virtual options remain difficult in a country where access to internet and computers is unevenly distributed . Tribal colleges in the United States serve students who live in areas who may not have consistent or reliable access to the Internet. “<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/03/16/tribal-colleges-report-pandemic-related-challenges-around-mental-health-persistence">Colleen Bowman, Navajo Tech's provost, said </a>she just received approval last week to purchase a drone to help with delivering the homework packets after she learned that some students were walking two miles to get to the pickup points.” <p><a href="negative.html">Read about more challenges</a></p>
