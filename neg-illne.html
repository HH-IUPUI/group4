                <h3>College students During the Pandemic</h3>
               <p>As of April 2021, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">there have been over 130 million cases of the Covid-19 reported</a>, with almost 3 million leading to death. At this time, it is difficult to empirically determine how the virus has physically impacted students on a global scale. However, there has been a large amount of discussion about the psychological toll that students have experienced as a result of the pandemic.  Case in point,  Finnish schools have been using the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMl_vNRBRTz/"> #eijakseta hashtag on Instagram</a> to call attention to the idea “Survival does not mean well-being”. This calls attention to the fatigue and mental strain students in Finland, as well as around the world, have experienced in the emergency transition to distance learning. Students in Finland are not alone. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FgXU0NK2HQWQ4fERa7z6MfOAwjc-Y-iR/view?usp=sharing">Sun, Goldberg, Lin, Qiao &amp; Operario (2020),</a> examined the impact of state mandated lockdowns on Chinese students. Of the almost 2000 responses, “Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation.” In a study of all French University students,  69,054 students completed the survey. Most of the respondents were women (50,251 [72.8%]) and many were first-year students (32,424 [47.0%]). The students reported a prevalence of suicidal thoughts 11.4% (7891 students), severe distress (22.4% (15,463 students), high level of perceived stress 24.7% (17,093 students), severe depression 16.1% (11,133 students), and high level of anxiety 27.5% (18,970 students). Among the 29,564 students who reported at least 1 mental health outcome, 3675 of them said they had seen a health professional.<p><a href="negative.html">Read about more challenges</a></p></div>
