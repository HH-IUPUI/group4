<p>CHALLENGES: </p>
<p>Overview Online learning can be as good or better than in-person learning. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/how-long-term-online-learning-in-pandemic-may-affect-college-students-well-being). This is usually true, however, when certain conditions are met, such as having students enrolled in online courses who are self-motivated to take classes in virtual settings, as well as courses designed by professionals who are trained in developing and/or teaching in online formats. Most students who engaged in online learning during the pandemic were not necessarily privy to these conditions. Instead, as referenced in other sections, online courses were primarily filled with students, who planned to be on campus and engaging in the various identities that students develop through their college career, have had to deal with a completely different context than planned. Some have had to learn whilst in isolation, and experiencing uncertainty about their status as students, and many other situations unique to the pandemic. Further, they may be dealing with existing structural challenges that were intensified during the pandemic. Such as institutions that were not prepared to support a large influx of online classes, or colleges who had to support classes for students despite large drops in enrollment and other sources of revenue. We discuss a few of these challenges on this site. </p>
<p>CHALLENGES: Infrastructure When a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization in March, 2020,  Karmachary, Paudel, and Adhikari (2020) noted that around 181 countries in the world have held back their  education  system  till  1st  May  2020  for  73.5% (1.3 billion young people) of enrolled learners worldwide (see:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344934039 ). When colleges and universities transitioned to online or distance education, the move was not equitable for all. According to United Nations estimates, about half of the world's population (46%) is not connected to the internet (see: https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/coronavirus-deepens-the-digital-divide/)  By October of 2020, Members of the European Parliament observed that “32% of pupils in some member states not having had any access to education for several months” see https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home.  This lack of access has helped highlight a digital divide that was persistent prior to this health emergency. In Nepal,  for example,Farid, Hayes, and Sirkhell (2021) highlight attempts to continue classroom learning remotely, through broadcasts on television and radio and online platforms, though virtual options remain difficult in a country where access to internet and computers is unevenly distributed (see https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/nepals-challenges-delivering-education-amidst-covid-19) . Tribal colleges in the United States serve students who live in areas who may not have consistent or reliable access to the Internet. “Colleen Bowman, Navajo Tech's provost, said she just received approval last week to purchase a drone to help with delivering the homework packets after she learned that some students were walking two miles to get to the pickup points.”(see: https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/03/16/tribal-colleges-report-pandemic-related-challenges-around-mental-health-persistence).  </p>
<p>CHALLENGES: Academics Plans Altered International students across the globe have had their academic plans altered. In China, Leung, Khan Saif and Chung (2021) write, foreign students are still not allowed into China to resume classes, but even elsewhere in the region, new coronavirus variants emerging in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa have led to new precautions on allowing in foreigners, including enrolled students. In Taiwan, students with special permission to enter the country obtained through Taiwanese agencies abroad were exempt from the new tightened regulations on travellers. Taiwan’s Ministry of Education stopped issuing such permits to students in January, after a handful of cases were registered in December, so only those who obtained permits earlier were able to enter the country, Mimi Leung reports (see https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20210227070651733) . In the United States, “The number of students enrolling in college immediately after high-school declined by 6.8 percent in 2020, according to a new analysis by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center” (see https://www-chronicle-com.proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/decline-in-students-going-straight-to-college-in-2020-was-sharp-but-not-catastrophic) They noted the rate was starker for underrepresented students, but did not detail by how much. Key (2020) shared, that graduation plans had been altered for 10% of students due to Covid https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/3279/coronavirus-covid-19-may-delay-graduation-students-of-color/)  This number is closer to 30% for students of color, who the  Understanding Coronavirus in America Study conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences reported have reduced the number of classes they have taken or changed college plans as a result of Covid (see:https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php). CHALLENGES: Illness As of April 2021, there have been over 130 million cases of the Covid-19 reported, with almost 3 million leading to death (see: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). At this time, it is difficult to empirically determine how the virus has physically impacted students on a global scale. However, there has been a large amount of discussion about the psychological toll that students have experienced as a result of the pandemic.  Case in point,  Finnish schools have been using the #eijakseta hashtag on Instagram to call attention to the idea “Survival does not mean well-being”. This calls attention to the fatigue and mental strain students in Finland, as well as around the world, have experienced in the emergency transition to distance learning. (Read more here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FgXU0NK2HQWQ4fERa7z6MfOAwjc-Y-iR/view?usp=sharing) Students in Finland are not alone. Sun, Goldberg, Lin, Qiao &amp; Operario (2020), examined the impact of state mandated lockdowns on Chinese students. Of the almost 2000 responses, “Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation.”(see: https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-021-00663-x) In a study of all French University students,  69,054 students completed the survey. Most of the respondents were women (50,251 [72.8%]) and many were first-year students (32,424 [47.0%]). The students reported a prevalence of suicidal thoughts 11.4% (7891 students), severe distress (22.4% (15,463 students), high level of perceived stress 24.7% (17,093 students), severe depression 16.1% (11,133 students), and high level of anxiety 27.5% (18,970 students). Among the 29,564 students who reported at least 1 mental health outcome, 3675 of them said they had seen a health professional. </p>
<p>CHALLENGES: Economics Covid caused many businesses to pause (some permanently). In order to ensure that people would maintain physical distances from each other. Places where people could congregate, such as restaurants, shopping plazas, and libraries, closed. In order to minimize spread, people around the world were encouraged or mandated to stay at home, which meant (in some cases) they could not go to work, or had to work from home. In some cases, governments provided unemployment insurance or living subsidies to ensure people were able maintain basic necessities in their lives, such as food, and shelter.  Students in many parts of the world were especially susceptible to financial hardships due to the nature of being a student. While in school, traditional students forego working full time in order to maximize their efforts to obtain good grades. This means that students from low-income households, they rely on income from jobs on or near their campus to make ends meet. Many of these opportunities for employment disappeared during the pandemic. As Levin (2020) reported: “Trapped between the financial hardships of the pandemic and the technological hurdles of online learning, the millions of low-income college students across America face mounting obstacles in their quests for higher education. Some have simply dropped out” (See: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/us/covid-poor-college-students.html ).  As Gao (2020) explains, “some college students have seen their parents laid off, lose jobs or close businesses — major events that have shaken their family finances. That’s forced some to have to jump in earlier than expected to help their family financially. And, it’s caused them to really take a hard look at their dreams.” see: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/16/as-covid-upsets-family-finances-college-students-rethink-their-dreams.html.  While the price of services stayed the same for students, some universities have raised tuition to stay afloat during this time period. For example, in Zimbabwe: Mashinings (2020) details, ”..state universities have increased tuition fees by up to a massive 450%, in a development which students said was insensitive, considering the economic crisis in the country” see: https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20210317201620580 ). Some students felt they had been shortchanged for the semester. “Students at University of California campuses and New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts have echoed similar concerns about tuition not adding up to the education they were promised. Students at Miami and Drexel Universities filed a class action lawsuit for tuition refunds, but most colleges have generally been offering refunds on room and board fees, not tuition”(Anderson, 2020, online).
