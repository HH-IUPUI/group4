        The Coronavirus pandemic has changed our collective way of life. It significantly altered the way many of us
        shop, learn, work, and live. It significantly altered the way many of us shop, learn, work, and live. It
        isolated large swaths of the global collective from friends and family. It impacted the physical and mental
        health of millions, in some cases, resulting in death or long term illness. The pandemic has turned normal
        living into a way of life many of us never fathomed. It is easy to get immersed in bad news about the pandemic,
        due to the disruptive way it exploded across all aspects of everyday life. This website will provide a brief
        glimpse at how college students were impacted by the coronavirus and the response intended to minimize its
        impact. For students, the challenges were significant.

        Online learning can be as good or better than in-person learning. This is usually true, however, when certain
        conditions are met, such as having students enrolled in online courses who are self-motivated to take classes in
        virtual settings, as well as courses designed by professionals who are trained in developing and/or teaching in
        online formats. Most students who engaged in online learning during the pandemic were not necessarily privy to
        these conditions. Instead, as referenced in other sections, online courses were primarily filled with students,
        who planned to be on campus and engaging in the various identities that students develop through their college
        career, have had to deal with a completely different context than planned. Some have had to learn whilst in
        isolation, and experiencing uncertainty about their status as students, and many other situations unique to the
        pandemic. Further, they may be dealing with existing structural challenges that were intensified during the
        pandemic. Such as institutions that were not prepared to support a large influx of online classes, or colleges
        who had to support classes for students despite large drops in enrollment and other sources of revenue. We
        discuss a few of these challenges on this site.
