                <h3>College students During the Pandemic</h3>
                <p>
           Covid caused many businesses to pause (some permanently). In order to ensure that people would maintain physical distances from each other. Places where people could congregate, such as restaurants, shopping plazas, and libraries, closed. In order to minimize spread, people around the world were encouraged or mandated to stay at home, which meant (in select cases) they could not go to work, or had to work from home. A few governments provided unemployment insurance or living subsidies to ensure people were able maintain basic necessities in their lives, such as food, and shelter.  Students in many parts of the world were especially susceptible to financial hardships due to the nature of being a student. While in school, traditional students forego working full time in order to maximize their efforts to obtain good grades. This means that students from low-income households, they rely on income from jobs on or near their campus to make ends meet. Many of these opportunities for employment disappeared during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/us/covid-poor-college-students.html">Levin (2020) reported</a>: “Trapped between the financial hardships of the pandemic and the technological hurdles of online learning, the millions of low-income college students across America face mounting obstacles in their quests for higher education. Some have simply dropped out”.  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/16/as-covid-upsets-family-finances-college-students-rethink-their-dreams.html">Gao (2020)</a> explains, “some college students have seen their parents laid off, lose jobs or close businesses — major events that have shaken their family finances. That’s forced some to have to jump in earlier than expected to help their family financially. And, it’s caused them to really take a hard look at their dreams.”.  While the price of services stayed the same for students, some universities have raised tuition to stay afloat during this time period. For example, in Zimbabwe: <a href="see: https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20210317201620580">Mashinings (2020) details</a>, ”..state universities have increased tuition fees by up to a massive 450%, in a development which students said was insensitive, considering the economic crisis in the country”). Some students felt they had been shortchanged for the semester. “Students at University of California campuses and New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts have echoed similar concerns about tuition not adding up to the education they were promised. Students at Miami and Drexel Universities filed a class action lawsuit for tuition refunds, but most colleges have generally been offering refunds on room and board fees, not tuition”(<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/13/students-say-online-classes-arent-what-they-paid">(Anderson, 2020) </a>.<p><a href="negative.html">Read about more challenges</a></p>
