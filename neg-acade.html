                <h3>College students During the Pandemic</h3>
               <p>
          International students across the globe have had their academic plans altered. In China, Leung, Khan Saif and Chung (2021) write, foreign students are still not allowed into China to resume classes, but even elsewhere in the region, new coronavirus variants emerging in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa have led to new precautions on allowing in foreigners, including enrolled students. In Taiwan, students with special permission to enter the country obtained through Taiwanese agencies abroad were exempt from the new tightened regulations on travellers. Taiwan’s Ministry of Education stopped issuing such permits to students in January, after a handful of cases were registered in December, so only those who obtained permits earlier were able to enter the country, <a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20210227070651733">Mimi Leung reports</a> . In the United States, “The number of students enrolling in college immediately after high-school declined by 6.8 percent in 2020, according to a new analysis by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center&quot; (from the <a href="https://www-chronicle-com.proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/decline-in-students-going-straight-to-college-in-2020-was-sharp-but-not-catastrophic">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>). <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/3279/coronavirus-covid-19-may-delay-graduation-students-of-color/">USC</a> explains that the rate was starker for underrepresented students, but did not detail by how much. Key (2020) shared, that graduation plans had been altered for 10% of students due to Covid.  This number is closer to 30% for students of color, who the  Understanding Coronavirus in America Study conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Research (<a href="https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php">CESR</a>) at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences reported have reduced the number of classes they have taken or changed college plans as a result of Covid.
